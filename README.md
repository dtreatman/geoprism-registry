## About The Common Geospatial Registry
The Common Geospatial Registry encompasses a collaborative framework for defining, accessing, and maintaining master lists of locations. This is needed to create a single source of truth for curated locations for use in an operational and reporting context.

The Geospatial Registry will focus on the following high level functionality:
* Defining and enforcing a specification for locations in the Geospatial Registry system.
* Ingesting and normalizing location data from disparate sources.
* Storing location definitions.
* Building digital tools for location data workflows and curation.
* Supporting an API to access locations programatically.

The Common Geospatial Registry is a part of the Digital Solutions For Malaria program who manages the over arching project publicly <a href="https://github.com/ds4me/ds4me-wiki/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.

## High Level Development Requirements
1. New development must be conducted in a new branch.
2. Pull requests must be requested to merge a new branch into the dev branch. 
3. The dev branch can only be merged into master if all tests pass.
4. Unit tests must be developed with best intent to ensure stability and consistency of API functionality.
