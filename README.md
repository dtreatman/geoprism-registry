## About
The Geospatial Registry encompasses a collaborative framework for defining, accessing, and maintaining locations across countries and programs. The Geospatial Registry will focus on the following high level functionality:
* Defining and enforcing a specification for locations in the Geospatial Registry system.
* Ingesting and normalizing location data from disparate sources.
* Storing location definitions.
* Building digital tools for location data workflows and curation.
* Supporting an API to access locations programatically.


This effort is a part of the Digital Solutions For Malaria program who manages the project publicly <a href="https://github.com/ds4me/ds4me-wiki/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.
